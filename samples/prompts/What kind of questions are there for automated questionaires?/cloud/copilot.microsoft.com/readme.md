### 🧠 **Types of Questions in Automated Questionnaires**

#### 1. **Closed-Ended Questions**
These are easy to analyze and often used for quantitative data.
- **Multiple Choice**: Choose one or more options.
- **Yes/No**: Simple binary response.
- **Rating Scale**: e.g., “Rate from 1 to 5.”
- **Likert Scale**: Measures agreement (e.g., Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree).
- **Dropdowns**: Select from a list.

#### 2. **Open-Ended Questions**
Used to gather qualitative insights.
- **Text Entry**: e.g., “What do you think about our service?”
- **Paragraph Response**: For more detailed feedback or storytelling.

#### 3. **Demographic Questions**
Useful for segmentation and analysis.
- Age, gender, location, occupation, education level, etc.

#### 4. **Behavioral or Experience-Based Questions**
Designed to understand actions or preferences.
- “How often do you use this product?”
- “What features do you use most?”

#### 5. **Conditional or Branching Questions**
These change based on previous answers.
- “If you answered ‘Yes’ to owning a car, what brand is it?”

#### 6. **Ranking Questions**
Ask users to order items by preference or importance.
- “Rank these features from most to least useful.”

#### 7. **Matrix or Grid Questions**
Efficient for comparing multiple items across the same scale.
