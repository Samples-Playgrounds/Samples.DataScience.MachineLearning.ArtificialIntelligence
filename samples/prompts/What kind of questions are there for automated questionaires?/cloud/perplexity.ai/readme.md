Automated questionnaires typically include a variety of question types designed to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. The main kinds of questions used are:

- Open-ended questions: Allow respondents to answer freely in their own words, providing detailed feedback.
- Closed-ended questions: Provide predefined answer choices such as yes/no or multiple choice for quick responses.
- Multiple-choice questions: Respondents select one or more options from a list.
- Rating scale questions: Respondents rate something on a numerical or descriptive scale.
- Likert scale questions: Measure agreement or frequency with statements, from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
- Matrix questions: Present several related questions in a grid format with shared response options.
- Rank order questions: Ask respondents to rank items based on preference or importance.
- Demographic questions: Collect background data such as age, gender, or location.
- Dropdown questions: Provide a list of answers in a compact dropdown menu.
- Slider questions: Respondents drag a slider to indicate a value on a scale.
- Other specialized types: Heat map, hot spot, signature, meta info, and captcha verification for specific uses.

These question types allow automated questionnaires to gather a wide range of information efficiently and can also incorporate branching logic where questions depend on previous answers, enhancing the user experience and data relevance.[1][2][3][4][8]
