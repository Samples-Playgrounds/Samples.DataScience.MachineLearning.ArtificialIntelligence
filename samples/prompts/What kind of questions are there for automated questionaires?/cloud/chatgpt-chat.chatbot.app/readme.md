Automated questionnaires typically include a variety of question types designed to collect specific information efficiently. Common question types include:

1. **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs):** Users select one or more options from a list.
2. **Likert Scale Questions:** Users rate their agreement or frequency on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5).
3. **Open-Ended Questions:** Users provide free-text responses for detailed input.
4. **Yes/No Questions:** Simple binary choices.
5. **Ranking Questions:** Users rank options in order of preference.
6. **Dropdown Menu Questions:** Users select an option from a dropdown list.
7. **Numeric Input Questions:** Collect numerical data, such as age or quantity.
8. **Date/Time Questions:** Users specify dates or times.
9. **Matrix or Grid Questions:** Multiple related questions in a tabular format, often with similar answer options.
10. **File Upload Questions:** Users upload documents or images as part of their response.

If you need specific questions for a certain purpose (like customer feedback, employee surveys, or medical questionnaires), I can help craft tailored questions.
