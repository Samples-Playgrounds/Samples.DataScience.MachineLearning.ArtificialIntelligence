Automated questionnaires, often used in surveys, forms, or data collection systems, feature various question types designed to gather specific information efficiently. The types of questions depend on the purpose, audience, and platform, but here’s a breakdown of common question types, based on standard practices and my understanding of how such systems are structured:

1. **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**  
   - Respondents select one or more options from a predefined list.  
   - *Example*: "Which of these social media platforms do you use? (Select all that apply) [Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn]"  
   - *Use*: Ideal for categorical data, easy to analyze, and reduces open-ended responses.  
   - *Variations*: Single-select (radio buttons) or multi-select (checkboxes).

2. **Rating Scale Questions**  
   - Respondents rate something on a numerical or descriptive scale (e.g., 1-5, 1-10, or Likert scales like "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree").  
   - *Example*: "How satisfied are you with our service? (1 = Very Dissatisfied, 5 = Very Satisfied)"  
   - *Use*: Measures intensity of feelings, opinions, or experiences. Common in customer satisfaction surveys.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**  
   - Respondents type free-text answers.  
   - *Example*: "What improvements would you suggest for our product?"  
   - *Use*: Captures detailed feedback or qualitative data but harder to analyze automatically.

4. **Yes/No or Binary Questions**  
   - Respondents choose between two options.  
   - *Example*: "Have you used our app in the past month? (Yes/No)"  
   - *Use*: Quick, clear responses for filtering or simple decision points.

5. **Ranking Questions**  
   - Respondents rank items in order of preference or importance.  
   - *Example*: "Rank the following features by importance (1 = Most Important, 5 = Least Important): [Speed, Design, Cost, Support, Features]"  
   - *Use*: Prioritizes preferences or evaluates relative importance.

6. **Matrix Questions**  
   - A grid format where respondents answer multiple related questions using the same scale.  
   - *Example*: "Rate the following aspects of our service (1-5): [Quality, Speed, Price, Support]"  
   - *Use*: Efficient for assessing multiple dimensions of a topic in one question.

7. **Dropdown Questions**  
   - Respondents select one option from a dropdown menu.  
   - *Example*: "Select your country: [List of countries]"  
   - *Use*: Saves space and works well for long lists (e.g., countries, years).

8. **Slider Questions**  
   - Respondents move a slider to indicate a value or preference along a continuum.  
   - *Example*: "How likely are you to recommend us? (Slide from 0 to 100)"  
   - *Use*: Engaging way to capture nuanced numerical responses.

9. **Demographic Questions**  
   - Collect background information like age, gender, income, or occupation.  
   - *Example*: "What is your age group? [Under 18, 18-24, 25-34, etc.]"  
   - *Use*: Segments respondents for analysis or targeting.

10. **Conditional or Skip Logic Questions**  
    - Questions shown based on previous answers, using branching logic.  
    - *Example*: "If you answered 'Yes' to using our product, how often do you use it? [Daily, Weekly, Monthly]"  
    - *Use*: Personalizes the questionnaire and avoids irrelevant questions.

11. **Image or Media-Based Questions**  
    - Respondents react to or choose from images, videos, or audio.  
    - *Example*: "Which of these logos do you prefer? [Image A, Image B, Image C]"  
    - *Use*: Tests visual preferences or multimedia feedback.

12. **Date/Time Questions**  
    - Respondents input a date or time.  
    - *Example*: "When did you last visit our store? [MM/DD/YYYY]"  
    - *Use*: Tracks events or timelines.

13. **File Upload Questions**  
    - Respondents upload files (e.g., documents, images).  
    - *Example*: "Please upload a photo of your receipt."  
    - *Use*: Collects evidence or user-generated content.

14. **Net Promoter Score (NPS) Questions**  
    - A specific rating question to measure loyalty.  
    - *Example*: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend?"  
    - *Use*: Gauges customer loyalty and brand advocacy.

### Key Considerations:
- **Design Principles**: Questions should be clear, concise, and avoid bias (e.g., leading questions like "How much do you love our amazing product?").  
- **Automation Features**: Many platforms (e.g., Google Forms, Typeform, SurveyMonkey) allow logic branching, randomization, or mandatory responses to optimize data collection.  
- **Analysis Needs**: Choose question types based on how data will be analyzed (e.g., numerical for stats, text for qualitative insights).  
- **User Experience**: Balance question variety to keep respondents engaged, avoid fatigue, and ensure mobile-friendliness.

If you have a specific context (e.g., customer feedback, employee surveys, academic research) or want examples tailored to a platform, let me know, and I can dig deeper or search for relevant templates!
