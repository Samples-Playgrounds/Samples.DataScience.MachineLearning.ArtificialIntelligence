In the context of natural language processing (NLP), we have three types of models that can be classified as follows:

Basic Language Model(s) - BLMs :- These are simple machine learning models developed to perform tasks like tokenization/segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. They use a set of preprocessed data for training the model which can be seen as an initial setup where no explicit neural network structure is applied in order to extract features from words that are then used by other models or algorithms like Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech Tagger, etc.

Training data: The training dataset should be a large corpus of preprocessed textual information for each task mentioned above to create the model’s underlying structure and allow it learn from examples during prediction phase when new unseen sentences or documents need to predict in real time using existing features learned by previous datasets.
Prediction: The basic language models use traditional ML algorithms (like Supervised Learning) for predictions, where they 'learn' the patterns of data and make predictions based on these learnt techniques until a new dataset is provided or if required re-training with updated labels/data set can be done.
Complexity: The complexity in defining how to tokenize words (break them up into individual parts), identify part-of speech, named entities etc., requires the model's architecture and training data for each task is quite simple compared to other models like neural networks or transformers which can handle complex tasks.
Limited Capabilities: Since they are not designed specifically as interpretable language processing engines (like RNN/CNN), so, there isn’t any way of understanding the generated text if it's a basic model in terms to understand human speech or natural conversation patterns with machine learning.
Overfitting and Understanding: Over time they can become overly reliant on training data for predictions as well because too much emphasis is placed upon these tasks which makes them more likely to perform poorly even when presented new, unseen scenarios of textual information due their complexity in pattern recognition or feature extraction.
Instruct Language Model(s) - ILMs :- These models are designed and trained specifically for language understanding (LU). They use supervised learning where the model is taught how to predict a word given its context, based on preprocessed textual data from various domains or scenarios that have been annotated by experts. Here's why they might be better suited: - Expertise : The ILMs are trained specifically in language understanding which requires more advanced linguistic and cognitive knowledge than BLM, but still allows for a greater degree of accuracy due to the larger range on tasks that can effectively learn complex patterns.

Training data is provided by experts who have worked with different domains (like medical information or storytelling) within these datasets are labeled correctly so as not only they would be able understand human speech in ways but also write down how humans speak and therefore could generate the language model's own responses to specific questions.
Complexity: ILMs often have more layers of complexity due to their multi modal learning strategy, where each task is done using different inputs (textual data for natural languages while visual or auditory input in case we are dealing with virtual assistants). However this also provides better context understanding since the model can understand patterns from various aspects.
Overfitting: ILMs face a problem of overfit as they tend to fit too closely into specific domains and not generalizing well when confronted by new unseen data (unlike BLM which is more likely with regard on complex task).
Over time, researchers are working towards improving the generalization capability in these models. Techniques like ensemble methods or transfer learning can be used to ensure that ILMs continue building upon a broad set of tasks while also generalizing well across different domains/scenarios using pre-trained representations from other datasets (like BERT).
Understanding: As the model is trained on annotated data, it should have better understanding in terms to understand human's speech patterns or any kind conversational context. It can be more easily understood and comprehensible than BLMs as they are less complex but with a greater range of task that could potentially learn advanced languages knowledge from diverse sources/scenarios through pre-training on vast amounts for tasks like NER, POS Tagging etc.,
Fairness: In terms fair representation in cases where the model is exposed to unseen or wrongly annotated data. The ability of ILMs not only understand human language but also generate text that still seems true/natural while avoiding biases and making them more transparent than BLM's complexity level
Explanations: As far as we can gather, the explanations are usually harder in cases where advanced models like CCLM use explainable AI (XAI) techniques. This makes ILMs better suited to provide a clear understanding of how they make their predictions and what features influence them while not being too complex about explaining themselves or needing more human input for tasks that can be done only with pre-trained data from other models/datasets.
Ease: As we know, the ease in which ILMs understand language depends on how well they are trained and what their purpose is as a model like BERT has been extensively used to train such tasks requiring no manual labeling or complex preprocessing steps for each individual task before use by machine learning models.
Usability: In terms of usabillity, ILMs can be particularly useful in NLP applications where the focus is on understanding and generating human-like text that might not always seem true/natural yet to generate it from a preprocessed set or trained model due their multi modal learning strategy.
Transparency: In terms of transparency as they are less complex but with higher level complexity in relation between prediction accuracy, context awareness etc., which is necessary for more sophisticated AI applications that could require understanding and generation to be both true/natural yet still understandable by a human user or developer who might not always seem so.
