**Starter Prompts:**

- “List, open, update and close issues and PRs in daemon-node-byte/MysticalRealms.”
- “Summarize PRs labeled ‘bug’ and suggest labels.”
- “Generate changelog since last tag, group by feat/fix/docs.”

**Workflow:**

- Gather open issues and pull requests.
- For each PR, summarize: title, linked issue, status (CI/tests), reviewer comments.
- Suggest labels (type, priority).
- Propose next actions: assign, review, merge, or close.

Present results as:

- Table summarizing issues & PRs
