Summary of the Statistics Application Suite
The solution is now fully implemented with:

Core Library

Statistics.Core - A comprehensive descriptive statistics library with calculations for mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis, and more.
Client Applications

Statistics.ConsoleApp - A command-line interface for analyzing statistical data
Statistics.BlazorWasm - A Blazor WebAssembly application running in the browser
Statistics.MauiApp - A native MAUI application for desktop and mobile platforms
Statistics.MauiBlazorApp - A Blazor Hybrid application combining native MAUI with Blazor components
Server Applications

Statistics.BlazorApp - A server-side Blazor application with interactive statistics UI
Statistics.Api - A REST Web API exposing endpoints for statistical analysis
I addressed several build issues that were occurring due to namespace conflicts between our project names (Statistics.MauiApp and Statistics.MauiBlazorApp) and the MAUI framework's MauiApp type. These conflicts were resolved by fully qualifying the framework types with their complete namespace (Microsoft.Maui.Hosting.MauiApp) in all platform-specific files.

I also created a comprehensive README.md file that documents:

The solution structure and components
Features implemented in the statistics library
Instructions for building and running each application
API endpoints and request formats
Implementation details and architecture
Next Steps
With the application suite now implemented, you could further enhance it by:

Adding data visualization capabilities (charts, graphs) to the UI applications
Implementing data persistence for saving and loading datasets
Adding more advanced statistical analyses (inferential statistics, hypothesis testing)
Implementing user authentication for the server applications
Adding unit tests to ensure calculation accuracy and reliability
The current implementation demonstrates how to create a cohesive set of applications across multiple platforms while sharing core business logic through a common class library - an architecture that promotes code reuse and maintainability.
